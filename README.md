# SubnauticaRandomizer
A Subnautica Mod that randomizes recipes for replayability

Warning!! This can make the game very difficult. You'll have to tweak it to get it the way you want to play the game.

The next time you open Subnautica, it should generate a "RandomSeed" in the file. You will have random recipe ingredients that will be consistent each time you load the game.

Please note the randomizer only randomizes recipes from the beginning of the game. 
The ability to randomize recipes takes some theorycrafting on what ingredients are OK to put in there, the later recipes haven't been thought through yet.

## How to develop/build

- Install QMod
- Git clone
- Add an environment variable to your machine, SUBNAUTICA_DIR, with the location of your subnautica folder.
- Visual Studio's build in the Debug configuration should automatically install the mod in the QMod folder.
